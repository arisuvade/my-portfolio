# My Portfolio

Welcome to the My Portfolio project! This guide will help you download and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **PHP** - The project uses PHP, so you need a local server like XAMPP or MAMP.
2. **Git** - To clone the repository.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arisuvade/my-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change to the project directory with:

   ```bash
   cd my-portfolio
   ```

   This will create a folder named my-portfolio on your local machine.

3. **Start the Local Server**

   If you're using XAMPP:

   - Place the my-portfolio folder in the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation.

   - Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.

   If you're using another local server, make sure it points to the my-portfolio directory.
